my Description
Fun fact ;)
Ever since I was young, I had heard this song once, never remembered the lyrics, or knew who made it. It stayed in my head for years and years, and eventually I started singing the lyrics that I thought I heard to the melody of this song that I hummed. Only recently had I rediscovered this song, and the nostalgia was crazy. Never had I experienced something that had brought back that much of my childhood to me. This song makes me feel happy, and puts my mind in what feels like a different place. Thank you Lumineers.
